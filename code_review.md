## Clean Code:
* Clean and well organized
* Seems to follow PEP-8
* Effective use of modular functions

## Good Documentation:
* Good commenting and effective use of docstrings
* Suggest utilizing markdown cells to explain workflow

## Proper Data Science:
* Sensible, efficient data cleaning
* Keep an eye out for colinearity between the multiple price features
* Make sure to scale features for all linear models, not just during Lasso 

## Comments:
* Suggest limiting output lengths to make navigating notebook a bit easier
* It'd be nice to see some additional analysis and explanation of feature selection and model results within the notebook
